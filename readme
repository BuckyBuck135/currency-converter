  /***** CODE REVIEW *****/
  
  Functionality & Design
  * works
  * loved how extended with currency and theming
  * clever use of number input
  * responsive
  
  Consider
  [x] Add cursor: pointer to button to make action clearer
  [x] Removing margin from outside the container
  [x] Think about contrasts for theming

  HTML & CSS
  * well-indented code
  * Use of headings
  * clear classes
  * well commented

  Consider
  //HTML
  [x] Semantic use of HTML elements
  [x] label for currency inputs
  [] names of ids
  //CSS
  [x] "appearance" property
  [] clearer css variable names e.g primary-colour

  Javascript
  * Const declared keyword
  * Ordered and clear
  
  Consider
  [x] having the exchange rate as a varible, so it can be changed
  [x] how could code be more DRY? Is there a way you could use a function with arguments
